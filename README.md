# PML2020
I don't have the exact version which got the best score as I didn't think at that time that this would be my final solution. So I simply didn't save the state of the process. I tried to make the solution as similar as possible.
I left the code with next changes that I tried just in case you would like to see them as well.

I've got two approaches to the problem. Both of them would be classified as second place according to Kaggle. One had MRE as 48K+ and the second one ha 49K+. So I'm including both of them.
